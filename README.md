# Alexnet-Pytorch-Implement
    
This repository is an pytorch implement of alexnet. In this example, alexnet was trained on cifar10 for 20 epochs and got about 83% accuary. You can also slightly  adjust its structure to train it on other dataset easily. Besides, alexnet_parameters_compute.py computes the parameters and neurons of each layer, which explains the structure of Alexnet. 
    
    nets.py has the structure of Alexnet.
    train_alexnet.py is the main program. You can run it to train alexnet on cifar10 dataset.
    alexnet_parameters_compute.py compute the parameters and neuron information in each layer of alexnet.
